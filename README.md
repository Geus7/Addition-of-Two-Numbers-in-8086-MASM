# Addition-of-Two-Numbers-in-8086-DOSBOX
8086 programming may be difficult unless its basic register architecture is understood.However if you are looking for a quick way to grasp a simple idea to it ,this repository might be helpful.
# After understanding the Register Architecture
First lets look at where to start
#
1.Download the dosbox version that is suitable for your system from any website of your choice. Some might prefer an emulator but it may take a while to understanding the value movement in the registers.
# 
2.Download a masm zip file->extract it to a particular folder(Remember this folder's name as we may use it for mounting)
#
3.Now mount this file in your dosbox
#
In the below picture you can see that I'm using a dosbox in windows, so the mounting process involves the follwoing commands.

#
4.After mounting we need to open a file.
 #
 This can be done by the command/code 
 
 [>>edit filename.asm]
 #
 5.You can enter the code here or edit it in an editor such as notepad.

 #
I would prefer editing in notepad as it lets us to edit the code conveniently in case of a large code.

 #
 6.Execution can be done with the following code.

 #
 7.Finally we can view the output by debugging when we find zero error.

 #
In the above execution you can find the addition of 4269+1000=5269 stored in the AX register.
